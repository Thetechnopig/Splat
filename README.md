# SplatMaster

A simple browser-based prototype of the **SplatMaster** kids art game. Sling objects from a cartoon slingshot toward a framed artboard and make colorful splats! Save your creations to a local gallery. The interface is bright and playful to keep kids engaged.

## Running
Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Your artworks will be saved in your browser's local storage.
Whenever you go back to the main menu or start a new painting, the canvas resets so you always begin with a blank artboard.
